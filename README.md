# OpenAstroTracker-Firmware
Official firmware for the OpenAstroTracker.

## Development

Even if Arduino IDE is supported, we highly recommend using [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/) for development. It allows automatic dependency management, powerful IDE, debugging, automatic build flags definition and more.
